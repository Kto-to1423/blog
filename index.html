                    The Venus flycatcher (Latin Dionaea muscipula) is a species of carnivorous plants from the monotypic
                    genus Dionea of the Dewberry family (Droseracea). A plant of swampy areas of the east coast of the
                    United States of America (North and South Carolina). The Venus flycatcher catches its victims
                    (insects,
                    arachnids) with the help of a specialized fishing apparatus formed from the marginal parts of the
                    leaves. The closing of the trap is initiated by thin trigger (sensitive) hairs on the surface of the
                    leaves. To slam the catching device, it is necessary to exert a mechanical effect on at least two
                    hairs
                    on the sheet with an interval of no more than 20 seconds. This selectivity provides protection
                    against
                    accidental slamming in response to falling objects that have no nutritional value (raindrops,
                    garbage,
                    etc.). Moreover, digestion begins at least after five times stimulation of sensitive hairs.

                    A dog (Latin Canis familiaris, or Canis lupus familiaris) is a pet, one of the most popular (along
                    with a cat) companion animals.

                    The domestic dog was described as an independent biological species Canis familiaris by Linnaeus in
                    1758; currently, this scientific name is considered by organizations such as the American Society of
                    Mammalogists[2][3][4]. Some sources (for example, ITIS and MSW3) recognize the dog as a subspecies
                    of the wolf (Canis lupus familiaris)[5][6]. In Russian-language written sources, the word "dog" in
                    the meaning of the corresponding animal has been found since at least 1475 (starting with the letter
                    of Prince Andrey Vasilyevich the Lesser to the Kirillov Monastery)[7][8].

                    From a zoological point of view, a dog is a placental mammal of the carnivorous order of the Canid
                    family.

                    Dogs are known for their learning abilities, love of play, and social behavior. Special breeds of
                    dogs have been bred, designed for various purposes: hunting, protection, traction of horse-drawn
                    transport and others
